The captain has thrown his anchor. My name is Captain Commandaria and I'm a bartender and teacher from the beautiful sea-bound town of Limassol in Cyprus.</p><p>Over the past 14 years, I've let my anchor down in 10 bars across 4 countries and 3 continents including North America, Europe, and Asia. Along the way, I've started something I love to call Bartenderology, my own school of drink mixing and bar-related craftsmanship.

It’s late morning, err, a late night and the cool breeze of the Cyprus’ Island blows right outside the bar. The soon to be Captain, sitting inside, sipping his drink still being the normal George he was until military was finished. Staring aimlessly into the abyss of nothing in front of him, his mind was already planning out his entire life. He wanted to finish university, get his degree from Inter College, work the weekends to pay his dues and graduate debt free. He wanted to go on and have a successful career as Financial Manager, yet what he did not know is what life had planned for him. Working the weekend job as he wished, he slowly and steadily fell in love with the art of bartending. Before he knew it, he was devoted to become the best he could, being the hard working and ambitious young man he is. Following his graduation, instead of pursuing a career in the field of finances, he decided to take up what he loved as a profession. He went on to work as a lead manager at Tycoon’s Bat in Cyprus as well as Floor Manager at Reybo’s in NY.Always seeking to learn more, he constantly surrounded himself with people who were more experienced than him, to feed off of their knowledge. </p></div><div class="content-details"> <h5>New Boats and Floats</h5> <h6>June 2014 - Present</h6> <p>A lot has changed since his days in New York. The captain soon sailed back to his hometown, quickly taking on the position of the general manager at the Tycoon's bar in the 5* Resort in Cyprus. As time passed, the captain started to feel the extreme need to pass his legacy on, looking into different ventures, he decided to take the first student for Bartenderology. In November 2017 The Captain conquered the Polish Winter. Mixing his legendary signature drinks in the Cyprus Corner of the Czeczotka Bar in the heart of Cracow, you can find him there now through Spring 2018, right off the Main Square.</p></div></div></div><div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12"> <div class="experience-content"> <h4>Bartenderology</h4> <div class="content-details content-border"> <h5>The First Apprentice</h5> <h6>June 2016</h6> <p>The second of the month marked a large milestone for the Captain and his team. That day, the first apprentice walked through the doors of the bar. What he didn't know at the time was that by asking to be taught, he not only gained a mentor, but also a new friendship for life. After 3 months of working with the captain, Christos started creating his own drinks, strongly based on different gins and combinations thereof. He soon departed the captain to start his own bar in Larnaca, staying in close touch with the captain. Following him, came many more, for shorter two-day crash-courses as well as for full summer internships. Coming close to the 100th student, Christos once again returned as a guest-lecturer to the interns for a two day-special evet, and just before leaving he left the small seed in the captain's head. What if the course went online, to make it even more accessible?</p></div><div class="content-details"> <h5>The Online Course</h5> <h6>October 2017</h6> <p>Low ad Behold, the Sails have been raised!
